Geometry Dash but you can use any song!

For this to work please follow two things below!

FFMPEG

This game requires FFmpeg to convert audio.  
Download FFmpeg here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

After installing, set the FFMPEG_EXE path in `game.py` to wherever FFmpeg is located, e.g.:

FFMPEG_EXE = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"

SPOTIFY API

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

2. Create an app.

3. Name it and describe it however. (The redirect does not matter)

4. When you first start the script you will be asked for these details

5. Done!

I cannot see any of these. It is important you do not share these with anyone.
